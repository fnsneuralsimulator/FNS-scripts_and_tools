VISUALIZATION:
Please find in the folder Matlab the two scripts used to visualize the network activity as rasterplots, signals and frequency spectrums. Additional visualization tools in python folder to create dynamical plots over networks' topology, and to export gephi compliant files with activity embedded. View examples in folders.  

CONFIGURATION:
Although a complete set of "configuration_files" is given (see "VARIOUS"), we developed the "Config wizard" for the automatic generation of the "config.xml" file.
